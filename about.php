        This website was created by the following four Oregon State students Timothy Oâ€™Rourke, Carson Pemble, Manuel Ochoa-Botello, and Sean Spink. The game was created as a project for the undergraduate course CS 340: Databases. This projects tests the ability to design and implement a web-based relational database system, using both php and an open-source database development system such as SQL. This project started with a project proposal and moved towards the creation of an ER diagram, relational schema, website layout and implementation, and finally to a peer review and class presentation.
